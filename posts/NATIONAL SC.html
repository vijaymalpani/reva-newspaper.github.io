	The Department of Biochemistry, School of Applied sciences organized the
	felicitationof Prof. Junjappa, INSA honorary scientist, REVA Universityon 28th
	February 2019 which is also celebrated as National Science Day 2019at 1st Floor
	Seminar hall, REVA University. The function was presided by Dr. P.Shyama Raju,
	Honorable Chancellor, REVA University. Dr. S.Y.Kulkarni, Vice Chancellor,
	REVA University graced the occasion along with other Dignitaries including
	DrDhanamjaya, Registrar, REVA University, Dr. N Ramesh, Dean, Faculty of 
	Science and Technology, REVA University, Dr. Beena G Associate Dean, REVA 
	University and Directors from other departments of REVA University. Around 110
	students and Faculty members were a part of this occasion of pride as Prof Junjappa
	received The Lifetime Achievement Award for his commendable contributions in the field
	of Synthetic Organic Chemistry at the 24th CRSI National Symposium in Chemistry held at
	Chennai on February 8th, 2019. The theme for National Science Day 2019 was “Science for
	the People and the people for Science”.Prof Junjappa is a living example for the theme 
	as he epitomises the triumph of will over constraints, of genius over circumstances. T
	he Seminar hall was named as Dr H Junjappa Seminar Hall henceforth by our Honorable 
	Chancellor Sir in honour to his legacy.

The trip commenced by the students gathering at School of Applied sciences, REVA University, and moved to the school by college bus. Many basic science models, charts, and presentation were prepared by M.Sc students to showcase and demonstrate which covers the broad area of physics such as Gravitation, Optics, Electricity, Mechanics etc. 

The school faculty and children were gathered for formal inauguration anchored by our PG students, Annapoorna and Manjunatha. The school Headmistress, R. Sudhasini addressed the importance of event to children.  After that a power point presentation on the revolution of science and technology since stone age to present era was given by our PG students.  

The exhibition of all science models were arranged in the school corridor and science behind the models were clearly demonstrated to the school kids. The children and the staff of the school were very supportive and cooperative throughout the day. 
The school children of 6th and 7th standard are also organized and performed scientific models of physics, chemistry, and biology.

It was a great learning experience for all the students. Everyone took part actively and enthusiastically. All are really enjoyed a lot.  After completion of the demonstrations, feedback has also been taken from the school faculty. The science models prepared by our PG students were donated to the school as a token of memory. After that we had the photo session with all faculty and students and return to REVA University by evening with great satisfaction.

After inauguration Keynote note lecture was given by Dr. Angappane S, Scientist, Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences Bangalore on Solar cells. He started with the theme of the science day “People for Science and Science for People” emphasising how science benefits the growing technology and makes the life easy. He gave the brief introduction about semiconductors, constructing the solar cells, working of solar cells, how the efficiency of the solar energy got improved by bringing modifications while preparing the solar cells, where does India stand in solar cell manufacturing, etc. The students were very enthusiastic after listening to solar cells lecture by Dr. Angappane S.

Dr. Yellammagad C V, Professor, Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences, Bangalore, gave a lecture on Liquid crystals: Life Science and Technology. He spoke about liquid crystals. Where liquid crystal exists in human body, and day to day life applications. Even the soap we take to clean ourselves is an example for liquid crystal and the TV screen we watch regularly and the smart mobile screen is liquid crystal. The type of liquid crystal and its classification based on its orientation was explained in detail. His lecture was highly energetic and motivating which gave the glimpse of Liquid crystals in life science and technology.
