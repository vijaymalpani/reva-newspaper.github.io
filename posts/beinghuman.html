					If you identify as someone that goes against the norms of the society, in a nation like India; the majority consider giving you, your rights as charity. All that one needs to lose their dignity in the society is to be a minority, religious, caste based, anything would work for that matter, and one just needs to be a minority. Especially if you are a member of the “miniscule minority”.<br>
					The transgender community in India is one that has been oppressed and is being continued to be oppressed. And then in 2014 comes the groundbreaking NALSA judgment by the Honorable Supreme Court of India, giving every citizen of the nation to choose their gender identity and gets the same on official documents as well. But the joy for the rights in this verdict didn’t last much for the trans-community in India; in 2016 the Lok Sabha passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of rights) Bill. Which sounded great, but when revealed; the policies came out to be violating most of the basic, human rights.<br>
					Recently on December 17, 2018; a bill with 27 amendments on the 2016 bill was passed, in the Lok Sabha.  The bill demands for the formation of screening committee which will test physically if a person qualifies as a transgender or not, which includes the individual applicant striping naked to prove their genitals to be “qualifying enough”, which is a pure violation of human rights and one’s dignity is at the stake. Also only after the completion of Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) they can apply for legal change in their official documents. The set up of a screening committee itself opens a new door for abuse on the transgender individuals along with what they are facing at the present. The bills criminalizes sex work and begging which is the only way of livelihood for many of the Hijras; a socio-cultural transgender community in the South-East Asia. This bill forces a transperson to reside with their families; often for most of the transpersons their house is the first place where they face domestic violence and abuse. While the bill is criminalizing their livelihood and all ways to survive, in the light of brutal irony there is no provision for jobs, education or any rehabilitation opportunities. I t is questionable that is this the kind of freedom, our ancestors really fought for? Does one really need a label to have a life of dignity in its basic form. <br>
